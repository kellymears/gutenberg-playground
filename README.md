# gutenberg playground

liberating "playground" from the @wordpress/gutenberg lerna mines.

these are just gutenberg editor experiments that can be run outside of wordpress. 

**Right now:**

- `master` renders the gutenberg editor to the admin's non-editor pages
- `bespoke-renderer` has an example of mapping editor output to construct your own html objects.

Did you do something cool and hacky with the WordPress editor? You fiend! Clone this, create a new branch, and open a PR!

Don't worry about maintaining anything in the branch you forked from. Just go ham.
